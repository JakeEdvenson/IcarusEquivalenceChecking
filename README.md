# IcarusEquivalenceChecking
A way for bfasst to do equivalence checking with waveforms generated by Icarus. 

**Steps to run Icarus & gtkwave:**

1. Clone Icarus to a folder using the steps at: [https://github.com/steveicarus/iverilog#readme]
2. Confirm gtkwave is installed as well
3. Use the command _iverilog -o (directory to outputfile dsn) (directory to testbench file) (directory to verilog file) (optional: directory to any other necessary module)_
4. _vvp (directory to the dsn file)_
5. _gtkwave -o (directory to the vcd file generated by the vvp command)_

**Notes on files:**
* waveform.py is a rough-draft of integrating these scripts into bfasst
* alt_waveform.py is an alternate test that also tests the original design on top of the goldenfile and the reversed-netlist
* TestBenchGenerator contains the code for creating testbenches
* DifferenceChecker contains the code for checking the difference between the files.
* BashCommands contains the bash commands I used to run Icarus tests. 

**Currently Supported Features:**
* Randomly generated test-benches (created in TestBenchGenerator/create_tb.py)
* Generated waveforms of goldenfiles and reversed-netlist files (managed by the bash script in BashCommands/runIcarus.tcl)
* Integration into bfasst (see waveform.py)

**Currently Not Supported:**
* Automatic waveform analysis to confirm equivalence without viewing the actual waveforms
* Automatic option to launch waveforms when any equivalence check comes back unequivalent
